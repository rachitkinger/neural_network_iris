# README
This script is a general algorithm to build a binary classification neural network in R without using any package. It only uses the base package and vectorises pretty much every calculation.  

It uses `tanh` as the activation for hidden layers and `sigmoid` function as the activation function for the output layer.  

It uses only 1 hidden layer with a default of 4 units.
