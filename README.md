# Neural Network Binary Classification
This script is a general algorithm to build a binary classification neural network in R without using any package. It only uses the base package and vectorises pretty much every calculation.  

It uses `tanh` as the activation for hidden layers and `sigmoid` function as the activation function for the output layer.  

It uses only 1 hidden layer with a default of 4 units.  

This is uses the same steps that Andrew Ng's Deep Learning AI module 1 uses in python, however, here it has been translated into R
